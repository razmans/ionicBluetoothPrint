# What is this?
-This is an ionic 2+ app



# What can this app do?
-Print on mini bluetooth printer with ionic 2+ app.

-Last check, I was able to print on a lot of the standard bluetooth receipt printer

-Works on both ios and android.

-Does not work on ionic serve, you have to compile the app and run it on a device

-Example: For pos system, for parking summons. 



# How do u start?
1. Install Ionic and npm

2. Install ionic native bt serial. See this link:
https://ionicframework.com/docs/native/bluetooth-serial/

3. All the stuff are in the home.ts and in the providers/print/print.ts files 

-The files are quite self explanatory, but if you need any help, hit me up on twitter @razmans



# Future TO DO
-Print bit based data

-Print bitmap images
